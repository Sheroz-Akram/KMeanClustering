## K Mean Clustering

<span class="colour" style="color:rgb(209, 213, 219)">K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping data points into distinct clusters based on their similarity. The "K" in K-means refers to the number of clusters that the algorithm needs to identify in the data.</span>

## Basic Working

<span class="colour" style="color: rgb(209, 213, 219);">The algorithm works by iteratively assigning data points to different clusters and calculating the centroid of each cluster. The centroid represents the center point of the cluster, which is determined by averaging the positions of all the data points assigned to that cluster. The algorithm repeats these steps until convergence, which occurs when the data points no longer change their cluster assignments or the maximum number of iterations is reached.</span>

<span class="colour" style="color: rgb(209, 213, 219);">Here's a step-by-step overview of the K-means clustering algorithm:</span>

1. Choose the number of clusters, K, that you want the algorithm to identify.
2. Initialize K centroids randomly in the feature space.
3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric, usually Euclidean distance.
4. Recalculate the centroids by computing the mean of all the data points assigned to each cluster.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until convergence (when the centroids no longer change significantly) or until reaching the maximum number of iterations.
6. The algorithm outputs the K clusters and the final centroids.
