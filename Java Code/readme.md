## Input Data Set

We give the program our dataset and it perform K Mean Clustering on the given dataset.
<br>

| ------------ | ------------ |
| 185 | 72 |
| 170 | 56 |
| 168 | 60 |
| 179 | 68 |
| 182 | 72 |
| 188 | 77 |

## Output

At the end the program would return us the clusters and the points in each cluster having minimun distance to the center.

| Points in Cluster |  |  |  |  |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cluster 0 | 0 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| Cluster 1 | 1 | 2 |  |  |
